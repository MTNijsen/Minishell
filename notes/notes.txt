| TO DO: |
----------

1.	First lexing cycle is for special tokens and text.
2.	Then there will be a second lexing cycle and this will divide
	the text in commands, in_files, out_files and just strings.
3.	There also needs to be expanding: when $"" is used, it has to
	expand into extra tokens. So not adding them to the end, but inserting
	them at the spot where they are supposed to be. 
4.	And also environment variables need to be taken in account.
5.	CMD should be the first argv in the proc struct.
6.	There will be a massive struct that will be passed to all of the functions. 
	Then there is no need to pass extra stuff to it. 
7.	Does that massive struct need to be initiated? Maybe in the main?
8.	We have to choose which libft we are gonna use.
9.	Figure out how to merge everything.
10.	Do some extra documentation.
11.	Laura: organize all of the folders and files.
12.	Fix Makefile so when compiling it doesnt make to many object folders. 
13. If the command line is as follows: echo hoi || echo doei --> it should only
	execute the first part. Everything that comes behind the || does nothing.
