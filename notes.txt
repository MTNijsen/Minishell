| TO DO: |
----------

1.	First lexing cycle is for special tokens and text.
2.	Then there will be a second lexing cycle and this will divide
	the text in commands, in_files, out_files and just strings.
3.	There also needs to be expanding: when $"" is used, it has to
	expand into extra tokens. So not adding them to the end, but inserting
	them at the spot where they are supposed to be. 
4.	And also environment variables need to be taken in account.
